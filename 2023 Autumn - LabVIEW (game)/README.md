# LabVIEW Final Project
*Team Project (2 people)*
## Intro
The final project needed to used LabVIEW to design a game. We chose to make rhythm game that is similar to [*Muse Dash*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muse_Dash). This includes making gameplay design, level file formats, visuals, autoplay, etc..  
In the end, we made 2 games with 2 difficulties, with result display system.

## Features
- Designed a custom file format to store the level data
- Using **masking** and **easing function** to achieve a better-looking interface

## What I Learned
- How to use **LabVIEW**
- Game design procedure

## Improvements
- Adding more features such as pausing, volume adjustment, more elements can enhance the player experience.
- A multiplayer mode that makes several players compete with each other can be considered.
