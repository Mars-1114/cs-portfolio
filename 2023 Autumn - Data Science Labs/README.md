# Data Science Labs
*Solo Project*
## Intro
We had to do 10 homeworks and a final project in this course, which mostly used the same dataset and are asked to study it. I used datasets about popular musics from Spotify and wanted to see how the trend goes over the years.  

>**Datasets:**  
[Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajatsurana979/most-streamed-spotify-songs-2023)  
[Spotify Tracks Genre](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/spotify-tracks-genre-dataset)  
[Spotify Top Hit Playlist (2010-2023)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/josephinelsy/spotify-top-hit-playlist-2010-2022)

## Goal
- Classify music genres using ***linear discriminant analysis***
- Observe genre trends over the years

## Result
- The model can classify the musics to some degree, but still has many overlaps between classes.
- The composition style of each genre has little correlation with the popularity of the song.
- Hip-hop has become trendy and EDM left the mainstream since 2017.

## What I Learned
- The use of **R Language** and **R Markdown**
- **Data Science** and **Machine Learning** basics
- The process of training model (clean up dirty data, train-test split, etc.)

## Improvements
- Trying different models may help me find out a better way of classifying the genres.
- Add or find more features to improve the performance of the model.
