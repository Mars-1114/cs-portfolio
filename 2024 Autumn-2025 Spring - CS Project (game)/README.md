# CS Project
*Solo Project*
## Intro
In this 1-year project, I made a **rhythm game** that is played with a **hand tracker** and its editor with an assist tool that can **detect song BPM and melody**.  

1. For the game, a 3D fixed position gameplay is chosen, with **LeapMotion Controller 2** to detect the hands' movement.  
2. An editor app is then created to help player design their levels. This is written in the **Avalonia Framework**.  
3. Two assist tools are integrated into the editor, including **tempo estimation** and **main melody detection**.
